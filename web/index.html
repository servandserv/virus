                    <h3>Destroy the virus</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this game mode you have got to try and destroy waves of viruses the way you start
                        the game is press the deploy the virus button a random virus will appear somewhere on 
                        the map. At the start of the game you get ten medpacks when you deploy the virus you 
                        need to try and destroy it so it doesn't spread but that almost impossible to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the virus infects 50% of the world then you lose the game the point is the 
                        game has a counter of days so you have got to try and make the virus take over 
                        slowly so the longer you survive the better we will put in a feature so you can 
                        put up your scores on to the internet.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Infect the world</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this mode you have to try and infect the world but only with one virus and the game 
                        only stops when you get to hundred % so it's the  perfect mode for getting highscores 
                        and checking out new viruses. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To start the game fist you have got to either choose a 
                        virus from the ones we made or make your own (we will add more viruses overtime). 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        We will add a posting feature so you can post your score online.
